## Two Opposites
Two opposites is a game about the journey of two opposites (characters with mirrored controls) separated by a mirror. They need to solve puzzles to escape the mirror world and finally meet each other. However, the challenge lies in the fact that they can only solve these puzzles together.  <br>
The game was made in a week for the Brackeys Game Jam (participated by 10k+ people worldwide) and ranked #22 in the innovation category. <br><br>
